# Wan's Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! This site is built with Eleventy (11ty) and is where I share my thoughts, projects, and explorations.

## About

You'll mostly find posts about technology, like programming, tools, and ideas that inspire me. Occasionally, I may also write about sculpture, painting, or other creative pursuits.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
   ```
3. **Build the site:**
   ```sh
   npx @11ty/eleventy
   ```

## Project Structure
- `.eleventy.js`: Eleventy configuration file
- `src/`: Source content (pages, templates, etc.)
- `_site/`: Output folder (auto-generated)

For more info, see [11ty documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).
