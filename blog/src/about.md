# About LLMentalist

This blog is inspired by the term "LLMentalist" as discussed in [this article](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/).

The author of that piece was on to something: they recognized the uncanny, mentalist-like qualities of large language models (LLMs). Their ability to predict, infer, and even surprise us with their outputs. However, I disagree with the negative connotations that seemed to come with that perspective.

While it's true that LLMs can sometimes feel like they're performing mind tricks, I believe that this "mentalist" behavior can be harnessed and applied responsibly. The key is to remain vigilant about the effects these tools have on us and the people we create things for. 

LLMs are powerful, and with thoughtful use, they can be a force for creativity, productivity, and learning. It's up to us to use them wisely, with care for both ourselves and our communities.
