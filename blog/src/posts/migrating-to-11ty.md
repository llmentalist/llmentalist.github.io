# Migrating from Obsidian to 11ty

For quite some time, I've been wanting to turn my Obsidian notes into blog posts. The idea of transforming those markdown files into a live site felt like a natural next step, and I thought it would be easy, after all, it's all markdown! But as with most things, the journey had its twists. Hereâ€™s how I navigated the challenges and why Iâ€™m now loving 11ty.

### **The LLMâ€™s Template Confusion**  
The first hurdle was getting the LLM to understand 11yâ€™s templating. Iâ€™d trained it on markdown and basic templating syntax, but it initially suggested Handlebars or Jinja syntax instead of Nunjucks.

I had to manually adjust the templates, ensuring all tags matched Nunjucksâ€™ expectations. It was a bit of a headache, but once I confirmed the syntax, the LLM became a reliable helper for generating dynamic content. It only took one or two nudges to get it working correctly. No external documentation needed! Except when I had to look up how to make images work. nd I still haven't gotten it to work with separate CSS files. ðŸ«¢

### **The Luxon Dilemma**  
Next, I ran into an issue with Luxon, the date library 11ty uses. The LLM suggested using it for formatting dates, but the build kept failing with errors about incorrect method calls. I realized the problem was a version mismatch: my Node.js version was too old to support the Luxon version I had installed.  

Switching to Node.js 24 fixed the issue. It was a minor fix, but it taught me to always check dependenciesâ€™ compatibility. Sometimes, the LLM canâ€™t see the forest for the trees, especially when it comes to environment constraints.

### **Why Iâ€™m Hooked on 11ty**  
11tyâ€™s simplicity and flexibility have won me over. Itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and adaptable; perfect for someone who wants to focus on content over infrastructure. Plus, the ability to sync Obsidian notes into a live site is a dream.  

Iâ€™m already thinking about building a tool to automate this process. Imagine a script that pulls markdown files from Obsidian, converts them to 11ty-compatible templates, and pushes them to a repo. It would save hours of manual work and keep my content fresh.

### **The Road Ahead**  
This project has been a reminder that LLMs are tools, not magic. They can help, but understanding the underlying systems is still key. With 11ty, Iâ€™ve found a balance between automation and control; a perfect fit for my workflow.  

Iâ€™m excited to explore how Obsidian and 11ty can work together. Maybe one day, Iâ€™ll have a sync tool that makes this process effortless. Until then, Iâ€™ll keep building, learning, and enjoying the ride.
